Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

This plugin provides you with an fixed sticky navigation bar at the bottom of your page in mobile view.
In this bar you will be able to add 2 buttons:
	1. Contact us - Which can be redirected to contact us page
	2. Call us - Which can be linked to phone number in order to make phone call with the pointed phone
	

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Extract to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Go to the plugin's menu and set your preferences for the sticky bar.

4. Enjoy

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
